An increase in its透气度 has been observed to have dual effects. On one hand, it leads to a decrease in the levels of nicotine, tar, and carbon monoxide (CO) typically found in cigarettes. This suggests that a higher透气度卷烟纸 might contribute to a potentially healthier smoking experience, as these harmful components are reduced. On the other hand, the increased透气度 also results in a rise in the total ventilation rate, which could impact the overall燃烧 dynamics and potentially alter the smoking sensation.
