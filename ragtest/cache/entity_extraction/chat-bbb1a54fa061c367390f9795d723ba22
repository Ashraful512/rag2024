tipping paper and filter on the filtration efficiency of cigarette the ventilation rates of paper and filter and total ventilation rate L27(3 13)split—plot orthogonal design was used in online experiment and sampling The test data were analyzed with intuitive analysis variance analysis and contribution analysis the results showed that 1)the length of filter draw resistance and air permeability of tipping paper were significant and important factors affectingthe experimental indexes 2)the paper and total ventilation rates were the highest when the length of filter was 27 mm and  draw resistance was 794 Pa 3)the filter ventilation rate and filtration efficiency of cigarette were positively correlated with filter length and draw resistance 4)the filter and total ventilation rates and filtration efficiency were positively correlated with the air permeability of tipping paper while paper ventilation rate was contrary\n\n基金项目: 云南中烟工业公司重点科技攻关项目“物理及化学
