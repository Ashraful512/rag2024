The data obtained from the tipping paper with different contact angles were analyzed, and the relationship between the contact angle, the number of holes in the glue zone of the tipping paper and the ventilation rate of cigarettes was compared and analyzed. The relationship between the contact angle of tipping paper and the ventilation rate of finished cigarette was established. the results showed that the larger the contact angle of the tipping paper was, the more coating liquid content and the less\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "qwen1.5/Qwen1.5-14B-Chat-AWQ", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 2000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
