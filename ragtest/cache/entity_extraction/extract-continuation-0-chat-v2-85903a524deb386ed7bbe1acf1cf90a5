PERA Shanghai Co., Ltd., Shanghai 200041, China\n\nAbstract: To investigate the influences of different cigarette material parameters on pressure drop, ventilation rate\nand air velocity distribution within an unlit cigarette, eight cigarettes with different material parameters were\nsimulated by using a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method with experimental results from the test\ncigarette materials. The simulated values were compared with the measured values. The results showed that: 1) For\ncigarettes without filter ventilation, about 4% of additional amount of air entered the cigarette through cigarette\npaper when the air permeability of cigarette paper increased by 20 CU. 2) Comparing with cigarettes without filter\nventilation, filter ventilation reduced the air intake through cigarette paper by\nvelocity through the ventilation holes reached 0.83 m/s. 3) Filter ventilation, cigarette paper with high permeability\nand grooved filter changed the distribution of air intake through cigarette paper, so that more air tended to enter the\ncigarette from its rear half part. 4) The maximum air velocity in the grooves of a grooved filter reached 3.9 m/s,\nwhich was 10 times of that in the other parts.\nKeywords: Ventilation rate of cigarette; Computational fluid dynamics\nCigarette material; Draw resistance detection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                2%-3% , and the maximum air\n\n\n\n\n(CFD); Simulation; Velocity distribution;\n\n\n                                             卷烟内部气体流场的分布直接影响卷烟的抽                                                                                    体力学（Computational fluid dynamics，CFD）的方法\n                                    吸感受、燃烧状态、燃烧温度、烟气扩散和过滤性                                                                                          开展卷烟内部流场的数值模拟和计算。Baker 等［1］\n                                    能等。近年来，不断有国内外研究者采用计算流                                                                                           最早根据达西定律计算了卷烟燃烧锥和周边的简\n\n                                    收稿日期： 2019-07-31                                 修回日期\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>082, CHINA<|>COUNTRY<|>082 refers to a specific percentage or rate in China, possibly related to cigarette ventilation or a regulatory measure)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PERA SHANGHAI CO., LTD.<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PERA Shanghai Co., Ltd. is a company located in Shanghai, China, involved in cigarette material research and CFD simulations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHANGHAI<|>CITY<|>Shanghai, the city where PERA Shanghai Co., Ltd. is located)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>200041<|>POSTAL_CODE<|>200041 is the postal code for Shanghai, China)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS (CFD)<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>CFD is a computational method used for simulating fluid flow and related phenomena)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VENTILATION RATE OF CIGARETTE<|>CONCEPT<|>Ventilation rate refers to the flow of air through a cigarette, impacting its performance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DRAW RESISTANCE DETECTION<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Draw resistance detection is a measure of the ease with which a cigarette can be drawn into the mouth)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PERA SHANGHAI CO., LTD.<|>VENTILATION RATE OF CIGARETTE<|>PERA Shanghai Co., Ltd. conducts research on cigarette ventilation rate using CFD<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CFD<|>VENTILATION RATE OF CIGARETTE<|>CFD is a tool used to study and simulate cigarette ventilation rate<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
