Meanwhile, a single factor experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of row number and position of perforation on the physical and chemical indexes of cigarette. The results showed that: 1) Within the test range, laser pulse duration affected cigarette ventilation rate and routine smoke constituent deliveries more significantly than did hole number. Laser pulse duration and hole number did not affect the ratio of signal to noise of cigarette ventilation rate obviously, but affected the mean value of ventilation rate significantly, which increased with the increase of hole number and laser pulse duration. The correlation between hole number and the...\n\nKeywords: Online Laser Perforation Parameters, Cigarette Ventilation Rate, Tar, Nicotine, Carbon Monoxide\n\n中图分类号: TS411.2 文献标识码: A 文章编号: 1002-0861 2014 11-0045-06\n\n基金项目: 上海烟草集团有限责任公司科技项目“在线激光打孔技术应用研究”K2011-2-003P。\n\n作者简介: 曹伏军(1971—) 硕士 工程师 主要从事卷烟\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ONLINE LASER PERFORATION PARAMETERS<|>技术/设备<|>在线激光打孔技术，影响卷烟通风率和烟气成分的输送)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CIGARETTE VENTILATION RATE<|>技术指标<|>衡量卷烟透气性的参数)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAR<|>化学物质<|>烟气中的焦油，一种有害物质)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NICOTINE<|>化学物质<|>烟气中的尼古丁，成瘾性物质)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARBON MONOXIDE<|>化学物质<|>烟气中的一氧化碳，有害气体)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEIJING WORK STATION TECHNOLOGY CENTER<|>组织<|>上海烟草集团北京工作站技术中心)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHANGHAI TOBACCO GROUP CO.
