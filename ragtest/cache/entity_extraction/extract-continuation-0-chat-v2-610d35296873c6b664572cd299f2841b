The result shows: ① Tipping paper glue spread has a dramatic influence on air permeability of tipping paper and ventilation rate of filter tip; ② The amount of tipping paper glue spread increases while the speed of tipping paper machine decreases; ③ Tipping paper glue spread increases while tipping paper wrap angle increases. The experiment also establishes the functional relationship between tipping paper glue spread and tipping paper machine operation speed, and the relationship between tipping paper glue spread and tipping paper wrap angle. When the operating speed of tipping paper changes, this model can stabilize tipping paper glue spread by adjusting tipping paper wrap angle, thus stabilizing tipping paper air permeability and filter tip ventilation rate.\n\nKeywords: air permeability, ventilation rate, stability, glue spread, tipping paper machine operating speed, tipping paper wrap angle\n\n随着降焦减害的提出，打孔卷烟接装纸在烟草行业的使用变得越来越普遍。使用打孔接装纸，卷烟的通风率会明显提高。为使卷烟通风率在指标范围内保持稳定，需对影响打孔接装纸通风率的主要因素进行�\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HONGTA TOBACCO GROUP CO LTD CHUXIONG CIGARETTE FACTORY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hongta Tobacco Group's Chuxiong factory in Yunnan, China, manufacturing cigarettes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHUXIONG YUNNAN 675000 CHINA<|>GEO<|>Location of Hongta Tobacco Group's Chuxiong factory)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZHENGZHOU UNIVERSITY OF LIGHT INDUSTRY COLLEGE OF FOOD AND BIOENGINEERING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>College of Food and Bioengineering at Zhengzhou University of Light Industry in Henan, China)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZHENGZHOU HENAN 450000 CHINA<|>GEO<|>Location of the College of Food and Bioengineering)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YAO ERMIN<|>PERSON<|>Author of the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GUO NAIWEI<|>PERSON<|>Author of the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZHANG CHAOSHuai<|>PERSON<|>Author of the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LI XIAO<|>PERSON<|>Author of the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JIANG XUEBIN<|>PERSON<|>Author of the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AIR PERMEABILITY<|>TERM<|>A measure of how air passes through tipping paper)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FILTER TIP VENTILATION RATE<|>TERM<|>The rate at which air flows through the filter tip of a cigarette)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GLUE SPREAD<|>TERM<|>Amount of glue applied to tipping paper, affecting its permeability and ventilation rate)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TIPPING PAPER MACHINE OPERATING SPEED<|>TERM<|>The speed at which the tipping paper machine operates, impacting glue spread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TIPPING PAPER.WRAP ANGLE<|>TERM<|>The angle at which the tipping paper is wrapped around the cigarette, also affecting glue spread)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HONGTA TOBACCO GROUP CO LTD CHUXIONG CIGARETTE FACTORY<|>AIR PERMEABILITY<|>The factory's tipping paper production is related to air permeability of tipping paper<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HONGTA TOBACCO GROUP CO LTD CHUXIONG CIGARETTE FACTORY<|>FILTER TIP VENTILATION RATE<|>The factory's tipping paper production affects filter tip ventilation rate<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GLUE SPREAD<|>AIR PERMEABILITY<|>Glue spread has a significant impact on tipping paper's air permeability<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GLUE SPREAD<|>FILTER TIP VENTILATION RATE<|>Glue spread also affects filter tip ventilation rate<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TIPPING PAPER MACHINE OPERATING SPEED<|>GLUE SPREAD<|>Slower machine speed leads to increased glue spread<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TIPPING PAPER.WRAP ANGLE<|>GLUE SPREAD<|>Increased wrap angle results in more glue spread<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TIPPING PAPER.WRAP ANGLE<|>TIPPING PAPER MACHINE OPERATING SPEED<|>Tipping paper wrap angle can be adjusted to stabilize glue spread when machine speed changes<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
