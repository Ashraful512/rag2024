The simulated values were compared with the measured values. The results showed that: 1) For cigarettes without filter ventilation, about 4% of additional amount of air entered the cigarette through cigarette paper when the air permeability of cigarette paper increased by 20 CU. 2) Comparing with cigarettes without filter ventilation, filter ventilation reduced the air intake through cigarette paper by 2%-3%, and the maximum air velocity through the ventilation holes reached 0.83 m/s. 3) Filter ventilation, cigarette paper with high permeability and grooved filter changed the distribution of air intake through cigarette paper, so that more air tended to enter the cigarette from its rear half part. 4) The maximum air velocity in the grooves of a grooved filter reached 3.9 m/s, which was 10 times of that in the other parts.\n\nKeywords: Ventilation rate of cigarette; Computational fluid dynamics (CFD); Simulation; Velocity distribution; Cigarette material; Draw resistance detection\n\n卷烟内部气体流场的分布直接影响卷烟的\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "qwen1.5/Qwen1.5-14B-Chat-AWQ", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 2000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
