The relative error of ventilation rate of cigarettes measured at 22.43℃ and 22.49℃ is within ±0.40%. The ventilation rate of most cigarettes is slightly increased under the influence of impact. Temperature factors play a decisive role in the influence of ventilation rate of cigarettes. Found through study the influence of the calibration for ventilation rate, temperature, within the range (22 ~ 28 ℃ after every 2 ℃, the ventilation rate standard rod to calibration of instruments, ventilation rate standard 0.05% measured value maximum fluctuation, cigarette ventilation rate measured\n\n82\n---\nvalue maximum fluctuation 0.07%, shows that the calibration instrument can effectively weaken the influence of the temperature measurement error for cigarette ventilation rate.\n\n(3) Through the verification of the verification method of the ventilation rate standard rod and the testing equipment, the verification method of the period is standardized and the best verification method is determined: the soapfilm flowmeter is used for the verification method of the ventilation rate standard rod and the standard verification method is used for the verification method of the ventilation rate testing equipment. Effective period verification can timely find abnormal conditions, reduce the risk caused by abnormal conditions, improve the controllability of the ventilation rate standard rod value and the stability of equipment, and ensure the continuous accuracy and reliability of cigarette ventilation rate measurement data.\n\nThrough the development of this subject, in the design of cigarette, the shape can be adjusted according to the ventilation rate design value porosity range of paper and paper, to realize cigarette ventilation rate control, and regulate the henan ZhongYan cigarette ventilation rate standard rod and testing equipment during verification method, improved the stability and accuracy of the test results, further improve the level of processing technology and quality of cigarette, To expand and strengthen the golden leaf brand cigarette to provide reliable quality control guarantee.\n\nKey words: cigarette ventilation rate; Smoke materials; External factors; During the inspection\n\n# 烟草科技 / Tobacco Science & Technology\n\n# 烟草化学 / Tobacco Chemistry\n\n2014年第11期 总第328期\n\nEffects of Online Laser Perforation Parameters on Cigarette Ventilation Rate and Deliveries of Routine Smoke Constituents\nCAO Fujun1 XIE Xiaocui1 WANG Xu2 LIU Chang1 YAN Lihong1 SHI Yuping1 HE Aij\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CIGARETTE VENTILATION RATE<|>属性|>衡量香烟通风性的指标，受温度影响，通过激光孔洞参数调整来控制)\n##"}]}
