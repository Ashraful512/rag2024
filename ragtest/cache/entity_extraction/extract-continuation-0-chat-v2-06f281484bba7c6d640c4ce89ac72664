The results showed that air permeability of cigarette paper had a large impact on the static ventilation rate of medium-sized cigarette which was positively correlated and hemp pulp content potassium-sodium ratio of combustion enhancer had a certain effect on ventilation rate of cigarette and weight of cigarette paper combustion enhancer content and ash content had little effect on the static ventilation rate of cigarette. The ventilation rate of the second puff of medium-sized cigarette was higher than the static ventilation rate. As smoking progressed the puff by puff ventilation rate decreased by about 5% for cigarette with different cigarette paper parameter. As the air permeability of cigarette paper increased the difference in ventilation rate between puffs increased significantly.\n\nKey words: medium-sized cigarette, cigarette paper, ventilation rate, puff by puff\n\n近年来，卷烟消费朝着新细分、新品类的方向发展，中支卷烟成为卷烟市场发展的热点。卷烟纸参数对卷烟抽吸过程中烟气成分的生成和递送有较大影响。目前，针对卷烟纸参数对卷烟抽吸过程和烟气成分释\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ZHENGZHOU TOBACCO RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF CNTC ZHENGZHOU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Research institute in Zhengzhou, He'nan Province, responsible for medium-sized cigarette ventilation rate studies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HONGTA LIAONING TOBACCO CO.
