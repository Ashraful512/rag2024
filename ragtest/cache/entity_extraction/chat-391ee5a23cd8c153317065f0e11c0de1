Meanwhile，a single factor experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of row\nnumber and position of perforation on the physical and chemical indexes of cigarette. The results showed that:       1)\nWithin the test range，laser pulse duration affected cigarette ventilation rate and routine smoke constituent deliveries\nmore significantly than did hole number；laser pulse duration and hole number did not affect the ratio of signal to\nnoise of cigarette ventilation rate obviously，but affected the mean value of ventilation rate significantly，which\nincreased with the increase of hole number and laser pulse duration；the correlation between hole number and the\n\n基金项目：上海烟草集团有限责任公司科技项目“在线激光打孔技术应用研究”K2011-2-003P）。（\n作 者 简 介 ：曹 伏 军（1971—)，硕 士 ，工 程 师 ，主 要 从 事 卷 烟 工 艺 与 材 料 研 究 。 E-mail：caofj2010@sina.com；* 通 讯 作 者 ：周 骏                     E-mail：\nzhoujun100@sohu.com\n收稿日期\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "qwen1.5/Qwen1.5-14B-Chat-AWQ", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 2000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
