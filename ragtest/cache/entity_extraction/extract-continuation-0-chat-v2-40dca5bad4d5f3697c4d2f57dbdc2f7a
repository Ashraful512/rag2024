In this context, people have\n             higher and higher requirements for the quality of fine cigarettes. Among the physical indexes of fine cigarettes, the\n             total ventilation rate has a great influence on the quality of cigarettes. However, in the actual cigarette production, it\n             is difficult to effectively adjust the total ventilation rate. In order to improve the total ventilation rate of fine ciga⁃\n             rettes in manufacturing process, the influence of different sizes of glue free area on the total ventilation rate of fine\n             cigarettes was verified by designing different sizes of glue free area of tipping paper cots. Through regression analy⁃\n             sis, the relationship between the glue free area of tipping paper and the total ventilation rate of fine cigarettes was\n             determined. The results showed that when the length and width of the adhesive free zone were less than 13 mm and\n             9 mm, the area of adhesive free zone was positively correlated with the total ventilation rate, and the correlation coeffi⁃\n             cient was 1.839 4.\n             Keywords: thin cigarettes；total ventilation rate；non-adhesive area；regression analysis\n\n    1  �\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>细支卷烟<|>产品<|>细支卷烟是一种烟草制品，其总通风率对质量有重要影响)\n(\"entity\"<|>总通风率<|>指标<|>衡量细支卷烟透气性的物理指标)\n(\"entity\"<|>无胶区<|>特征<|>接装纸上的无胶区域，与细支烟总通风率相关)\n(\"entity\"<|>回归分析<|>方法<|>用于研究接装纸无胶区与总通风率之间的关系)\n\n(\"relationship\"<|>无胶区<|>细支卷烟<|>无胶区的大小对细支卷烟的总通风率有影响<|>1.8394)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
