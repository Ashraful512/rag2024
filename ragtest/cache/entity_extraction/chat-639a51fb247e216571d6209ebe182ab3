By studying the influences of the air permeability of the molding paper, the air permeability of the connecting paper and the number of perforations on the ventilation rate of cigarettes, the results show that: There was a significant positive correlation between the air permeability of packing paper and the number of perforations and the ventilation rate of cigarette, and the correlation coefficient of the influence of packing paper and the number of perforations on the ventilation rate of cigarette filter, as well as the interaction effect of molding paper, packing paper and the number of perforations on the ventilation rate of cigarette filter, the three could coordinate to adjust the ventilation rate of cigarette. When the air permeability of molded paper is between 3500CU and 7500CU, the increase of air permeability is beneficial to improve the ventilation rate of cigarette, and the fluctuation range of ventilation rate of cigarette filter can be effectively controlled.\n2. Based on the current situation of large temperature difference between laboratory and workshop comprehensive test bench, the influence of impact times, temperature factors and calibration factors on the measurement results of cigarette ventilation rate was explored. The research shows that: When the temperature is in the range of (22~28) ℃, the measured result of ventilation rate standard rod can increase by 0.38%, and the measured result of cigarette ventilation rate can increase by 0.16%. The relative error of ventilation rate of cigarettes measured at 22.43℃ and 22.49℃ is within ±0.40%. The ventilation rate of most cigarettes is slightly increased under the influence of impact. Temperature factors play a decisive role in the influence of ventilation rate of cigarettes. Found through study the influence of the calibration for ventilation rate, temperature, within the range (22 ~ 28 ℃ after\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "qwen1.5/Qwen1.5-14B-Chat-AWQ", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 2000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
