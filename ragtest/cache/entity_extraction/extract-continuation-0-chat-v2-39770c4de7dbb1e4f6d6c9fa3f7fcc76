No. 2) without ventilation (A. streamline, B. press drop)\n\n从流线图中可以清晰地看到空气流入卷烟的部位主要有烟支燃吸端面和卷烟纸。燃吸端面是空气进入卷烟的主要通道，有接近90%空气从卷烟端面直接进入烟支。在烟支端面附近，大量空气流线呈放射状汇流入烟支，少量空气垂直穿过卷烟纸后进入烟支，且越靠近滤嘴部分穿过卷烟纸的空气量越多，流线越密集。\n\n由表3可以看出，所有试样卷烟吸阻的模拟值与实测值非常接近，平均偏差约15 Pa。可见该仿真模型可信度较高。卷烟纸进气量的模拟值与预测值的平均偏差为1.5%，且均为正偏差，即模拟值较实测值略微偏高。这主要是由于两方面原因：①卷烟纸在卷接成型过程中有约2 mm的涂胶搭口，搭口部位由于上胶的关系透气性显著下降。②模拟中为了简化计算认为卷烟纸、接装纸均满足达西定律，但实际使用中卷烟纸的透气性\n######################\nOutput:"},
