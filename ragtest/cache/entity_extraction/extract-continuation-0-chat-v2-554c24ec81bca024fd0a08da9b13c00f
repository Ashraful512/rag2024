Bengbu Cigarette Factory, China Tobacco Anhui Industrial Co., Ltd., Bengbu 233010, Anhui, China\n\n      Abstract: To investigate the influences of preperforated tipping paper gluing factors on the ventilation rate of\n      cigarette, a tipping paper gluing effect evaluation and            gluing position adjustment method was developed. With\n      glue-free zone in its right position, the influences of the length and width of glue-free zone and gluing thickness\n      on the ventilation rate were studied via an orthogonal experiment. The results showed that: 1) These factors in\n      the order of influence on the ventilation rate were glue-free zone length                    ＞   glue-free zone width       ＞   gluing\n      thickness, wherein the influence of glue-free zone length reached a significance level. 2) With the extension of\n      glue-free   zone,   the  average    ventilation   rate  increased,    while  the   coefficient   of  variation   of  ventilation   rate\n      decreased.    3) The optimal parameters of glue roller for cigarette brand“Huangshan (B)”were glue-free zone\n      length 22 mm, width 8 mm, and gluing thickness 0.03 mm. The mentioned method provides a technical support\n      for promoting the consistency of ventilation rate of cigarette with preperforated tipping paper.\n      Keywords: Preperforated cigarette; Ventilation rate; Tipping paper; Gluing effect; Orthogonal experiment; Glue\n      roller\n\n            降焦减害是近年来烟草行业研究及关注的热                                             用且效果较好的一项降焦减害技术，原因是卷烟\n      点问题，接装纸打孔通风则是各工业企业普遍采                                                 通风率会直接影响卷烟焦油量和感官质量［1-5］，因\n      收稿日期：2017-09-15                修回日期：2018-02-02\n      �\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>Tobacco Anhui Industrial Co., Ltd.<|>ORGANIZATION<|>中国烟草安徽工业公司, 安徽省合肥市230088, 中国)\n(\"entity\"<|>Bengbu Cigarette Factory<|>ORGANIZATION<|>中国烟草安徽工业公司 Bengbu分厂, 安徽省蚌埠市233010, 安徽省)\n(\"entity\"<|>Huangshan (B) cigarette<|>PRODUCT<|>黄山牌香烟, 优化通风率的卷烟产品)\n(\"entity\"<|>Preperforated tipping paper<|>PRODUCT<|>预打孔接装纸, 影响通风率的关键材料)\n(\"entity\"<|>Glue roller<|>PRODUCT<|>胶辊, 用于接装纸打孔粘贴的设备)\n(\"relationship\"<|>Tobacco Anhui Industrial Co., Ltd.<|>Bengbu Cigarette Factory<|>Bengbu Cigarette Factory是Tobacco Anhui Industrial Co., Ltd.的一个分厂<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>Preperforated tipping paper<|>Ventilation rate<|>接装纸打孔对通风率有直接影响<|>9)\n(\"relationship\"<|>Glue roller<|>Tipping paper gluing<|>胶辊用于接装纸的粘贴工艺<|>6)\n(\"relationship\"<|>Preperforated tipping paper<|>Glue roller<|>胶辊的参数对接装纸通风率有影响<|>5)\n(\"relationship\"<|>Huangshan (B) cigarette<|>Glue roller<|>优化Huangshan (B)香烟的通风率需要调整胶辊参数<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
