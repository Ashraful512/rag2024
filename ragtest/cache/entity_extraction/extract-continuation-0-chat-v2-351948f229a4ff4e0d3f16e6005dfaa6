Summary of Multi-Set Comparison Method\n\na. In the 4 tests, instrument D1 had 3 negative deviations and 1 positive deviation, with significant deviations from the mean.\n\nb. If instrument D1 is excluded, the results of the 4 measurements at the other 7 comprehensive test stations show little fluctuation.\n\nc. The ventilation rate unit can be verified during the period using the multi-set comparison method.\n\n# 4.3.2.3 Conventional Control Chart Method\n\nThe conventional control chart method is a graphical method for controlling the production process, based on the principle of significance statistics, extracting data from the process in approximately equal time or equal quantities to form subgroups, obtaining one or more subgroup characteristics from each subgroup, such as subgroup mean, range R, standard deviation s. The conventional control chart is a graphical representation of subgroup characteristics values corresponding to subgroup numbers, including a centerline CL, upper control limit UCL, and lower control limit LCL determined by statistical methods. The centerline is the average value of the controlled statistical quantity, and the upper and lower control limits are located on the upper and lower sides of the centerline, respectively, and are a few standard deviations away from the centerline. If the data is within the control limits, it indicates that the measurement process is in a state of statistical control; if the data is outside the control limits, it indicates that the measurement process is out of control. GB/T 4091-2001 \"Conventional Control Chart\" provides guidelines for using conventional control charts, also known as Shewhart control charts.\n\nWhen using the conventional control chart for the periodic verification of instruments, the object being verified needs to repeatedly measure objects with good stability and repeatability, draw an average value control chart based on the measurement results, and if the verification results are within the upper and lower control limits, it indicates a successful verification. The normal distribution is the most common form of data distribution. According to statistical theory, the two parameters of the normal distribution, the mean μ and the standard deviation σ, are independent of each other. Regardless of the values of μ and σ, the probability that the quality characteristics of the product fall within the range [μ-3σ, μ+3σ] is 99.73%, and the probability of falling outside this interval is 0.27%, which is a low probability event that is unlikely to occur in a single\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>INSTRUMENT D1<|>卷烟通风率<|>Instrument D1 has 3 negative deviations and 1 positive deviation in 4 tests, deviating significantly from the mean)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMPREHENSIVE TEST STATIONS<|>卷烟通风率<|>Seven comprehensive test stations where instrument D1 was excluded show little fluctuation in results)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VENTILATION RATE UNIT<|>卷烟通风率<|>The ventilation rate can be verified using the multi-set comparison method during a specific period)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONVENTIONAL CONTROL CHART METHOD<|>卷烟通风率<|>A graphical method for controlling production processes based on statistical significance, involving subgroup characteristics like mean, range, and standard deviation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GB/T 4091-2001<|>标准<|>Standard for conventional control charts, also known as Shewhart control charts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEAN<|>卷烟通风率<|>Average value of the controlled statistical quantity in a normal distribution)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STANDARD DEVIATION<|>卷烟通风率<|>Measure of dispersion in the normal distribution, used in control limits)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INSTRUMENT D1<|>COMPREHENSIVE TEST STATIONS<|>Instrument D1's verification results are compared across multiple test stations to assess stability and repeatability<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INSTRUMENT D1<|>CONVENTIONAL CONTROL CHART<|>Instrument D1's verification results are plotted on a control chart to determine if it's within the control limits, indicating successful verification<|>95)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMPREHENSIVE TEST STATIONS<|>CONVENTIONAL CONTROL CHART<|>The stability and repeatability of instrument D1 are evaluated using control charts based on data from these stations<|>95)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
