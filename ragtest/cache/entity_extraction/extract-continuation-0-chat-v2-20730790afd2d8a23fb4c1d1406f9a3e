为探讨卷烟纸、成型纸、接装纸及滤嘴组合搭配对纸通风率、滤嘴通风率、总通风率及卷烟过滤效率的影响规律 采用L  (3”)裂区正交设计方法进行在线试验和取样。检测结果经过直观分析、方差分析及贡献率分析 结果表明 滤嘴长度、吸阻及接装纸透气度是影响试验指标的显著因素和重要因素 滤嘴长度为27 mm 吸阻为794 Pa卷烟的纸通风率及总通风率最大 滤嘴长度或吸阻越大 卷烟的滤嘴通风率及过滤效率也越大 接装纸透气度越大 滤嘴通风率、总通风率及过滤效率也越大 而纸通风率则越小。\n\n中图分类号 TS457 TS761 2文献标识码 B文章编号 1002—0861(2008)11—0009—05\n\nEffects of Cigarette Materials oR Ventilation Rate and Filtration Efficiency of Cigarette\n\n|WEI
