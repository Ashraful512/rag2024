Bengbu Cigarette Factory, China Tobacco Anhui Industrial Co., Lp., Bengbu 233010, Anhui, China\n\nAbstract: To investigate the influences of preperforated tipping paper gluing factors on the ventilation rate of cigarette, a tipping paper gluing effect evaluation and gluing position adjustment method was developed. With glue-free zone in its right position, the influences of the length and width of glue-free zone and gluing thickness on the ventilation rate were studied via an orthogonal experiment. The results showed that: 1) These factors in the order of influence on the ventilation rate were glue-free zone length, glue-free zone width, gluing thickness, wherein the influence of glue-free zone length reached a significance level. 2) With the extension of glue-free zone, the average ventilation rate increased, while the coefficient of variation of ventilation rate decreased. 3) The optimal parameters of glue roller for cigarette brand “Huangshan (B)” were glue-free zone length 22 mm, width 8 mm, and gluing thickness 0.03 mm. The mentioned method provides a technical support for promoting the consistency of ventilation rate of cigarette with preperforated tipping paper.\n\nKeywords: Preperforated cigarette; Ventilation rate; Tipping paper; Gluing effect; Orthogonal experiment; Glue roller\n\n降焦减害是近年来烟草行业研究及关注的热点问题 接装纸打孔通风则是各工业企业普遍采用且\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "qwen1.5/Qwen1.5-14B-Chat-AWQ", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 2000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
