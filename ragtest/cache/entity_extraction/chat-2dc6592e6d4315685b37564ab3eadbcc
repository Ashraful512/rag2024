        In      order          to     guarantee               the       stability            of     tipping           paper           air       permeability                 and         filter

per-\nmeability and filter tip ventilation rate，                                                     and the correlation between tippi pape glue spread varying along with tipping paper\nmachine operating rate and tipping paper wrap angle． The result shows：①                                                                                                        Tipping paper glue spread has a

and the relationship between tipping paper glue spread and tipping paper wrap angle． When the oper-\nating speed of tipping paper changes，                                                      this model can stabilize tipping paper glue spread by adjusting tipping paper wrap an-\ngle， thus stabilizing tipping paper air permeability and filter tip ventilation rate．\nKey words：air permeability；
