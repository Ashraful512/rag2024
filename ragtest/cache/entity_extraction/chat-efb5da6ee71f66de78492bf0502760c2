The results showed that air permeability of cigarette paper had a large impact on the static ventilation\n rate of medium-sized cigarette，which was positively correlated，and hemp pulp content，potassium-sodium ratio of combustion enhancer had\n a certain effect on ventilation rate of cigarette，and weight of cigarette paper，combustion enhancer content，and ash content had little effect\n on the static ventilation rate of cigarette. The ventilation rate of the second puff of medium-sized cigarette was higher than the static ventila‐\n tion rate. As smoking progressed，the puff by puff ventilation rate decreased by about 5% for cigarette with different cigarette paper parame‐\n ter. As the air permeability of cigarette paper increased，the difference in ventilation rate between puffs increased significantly.\n Key words：medium-sized cigarette；cigarette paper；ventilation rate；puff by puff\n\n      近年来，卷烟消费朝着新细分、新品类的方向发                                      成分释放量符合度的影响。戴路等[4]研究了不同钾离\n 展，中支卷烟成为卷烟市场发展的热点[1]。卷烟\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "qwen1.5/Qwen1.5-14B-Chat-AWQ", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 2000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
