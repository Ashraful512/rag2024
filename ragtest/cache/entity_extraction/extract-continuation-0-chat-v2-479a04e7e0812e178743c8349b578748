为考察预打孔卷烟接装纸施胶效果对通风率的影响，建立了一种接装纸施胶效果评价及无胶区偏移时的优化调整方法。在无胶区处于理想状态下利用正交试验研究了无胶区长度、宽度以及施胶厚度对通风率的影响。结果表明：①对预打孔卷烟通风率的影响依次为无胶区长度、宽度和施胶厚度，无胶区长度对通风率的影响达到显著水平。②随着无胶区长度的增加，预打孔卷烟通风率均值呈上升趋势，通风率变异系数呈下降趋势。③根据试验结果可确定“黄山 B”牌号卷烟最佳胶辊参数组合为无胶区长度 22 mm，宽度 8 mm，施胶厚度 0.03 mm。该方法为提高预打孔卷烟通风率的稳定性提供了技术支持。\n\n关键词: 预打孔卷烟，通风率，接装纸，施胶效果，正交试验，胶辊\n\n中图分类号 TS433 文献标志码 A 文章编号 1002-0861 2018 05-0081-06\n\nInfluences of preperforated
