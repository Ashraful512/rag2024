{"result": "CO, also known as carbon monoxide, is a harmful substance primarily produced by the incomplete combustion of tobacco, such as during smoking. It is a key component of smoke, particularly in the context of cigarette smoke, and its presence is influenced by factors like ventilation rate. In the ISO smoking method, the delivery of CO is positively correlated with the ventilation rate of the cigarette, indicating that higher ventilation allows for more CO release.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
