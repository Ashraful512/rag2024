# Figure 4-15 Error of five ventilation rate measurements

（a）The comprehensive test bench measured 3 ventilation rate standard rods of 17.64%, 45.31%, and 81.66% five times each, with relatively small fluctuations in the results.

（b）In the 5 test results, the maximum error at 17.64% is -0.83%, and the minimum error is -0.48%; at 45.31%, the maximum error is -1.7%, and the minimum error is -0.75%; at 81.66%, the maximum error is 0.85%, and the minimum error is -0.7%.

（c）At the three points of 17.64%, 45.31%, and 81.66%, the comprehensive test bench is within the maximum allowable error range.

（d）Among the 5 measurement results, the error in the indication of the ventilation rate standard rod at 17.64% fluctuates slightly, while the error in the indication of the ventilation rate standard rods at 45.31% and 81.66% fluctuates significantly.
