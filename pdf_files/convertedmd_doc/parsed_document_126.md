# Figure 4-37 Ventilation rate unit five times measurement control diagram

(a) The comprehensive test bench measures 3 standard ventilation rods of 17.64%, 45.31%, and 81.66% five times each, and the measurement results are all within the upper and lower control limits.

(b) When measuring the 17.64% and 45.31% standard rods, the actual ventilation rates measured five times are generally smaller than the standard values; when measuring the 81.66% standard rod, the actual ventilation rates measured five times are mostly larger than the standard values.

(b) When measuring the 17.64% and 45.31% standard rods, the actual ventilation rates measured five times are generally smaller than the standard values; when measuring the 81.66% standard rod, most of the actual ventilation rates measured five times are larger than the standard values.
