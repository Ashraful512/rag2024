# Figure 4-22 Error of four ventilation rate measurements

(a) The comprehensive test bench measured 3 standard ventilation rods at 17.64%, 45.31%, and 81.66% four times each, with small fluctuations in the results.

(b) In the 4 test results, the maximum error at 17.64% is 0.4%, and the minimum error is -0.1%; at 45.31%, the maximum error is 0.4%, and the minimum error is -0.3%; at 81.66%, the maximum error is 0.5%, and the minimum error is -0.4%.

(c) The comprehensive test bench's ventilation rates at 17.64%, 45.31%, and 81.66% are all within the maximum allowable error range.

(5) Comparison of measurement results between laboratory and workshop instrument A for the same manufacturer but different environments

For the comprehensive test benches from the same manufacturer but in different environments, the measurement results of 3 different ventilation rate standard rods are compared.

| |Instrument A| |
|---|---|---|
|18.5|17.5|47|
|16.5|15.5| |

(a) Measurement of 17.64% ventilation rate standard rod

(b) Measurement of 45.31% ventilation rate standard rod

(c) Measurement of 81.66% ventilation rate standard rod

Figure 4-23 Comparison of measurement results between laboratory and workshop instrument A

(a) Measuring 3 different values of ventilation rate standard rods, the laboratory measurement results are very close to the workshop measurement results for 17.64% and 45.31% ventilation rate standard rods; for the 81.66% ventilation rate standard rod, except for the first measurement result, the other 3 laboratory measurement results are very close to the workshop measurement results.

(b) The measurement results of the comprehensive test bench in the laboratory and workshop are generally smaller than the standard values of the ventilation rate standard rods.
