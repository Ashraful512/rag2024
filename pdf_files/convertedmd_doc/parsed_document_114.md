# Figure 4-21 Error of four ventilation rate measurements

（a）The comprehensive test bench measured 3 ventilation rate standard rods of 17.64%, 45.31%, and 81.66% four times each, with relatively large fluctuations in the results.

（b）In the 4 test results, the maximum error at 17.64% is 6.5%, and the minimum error is -1.9%; at 45.31%, the maximum error is 14.0%, and the minimum error is -5.6%; at 81.66%, the maximum error is 19.7%, and the minimum error is -12.9%.

（c）The first and second ventilation rate measurements on the comprehensive test bench are relatively close, with only an overage at 81.66%; the third measurement results are generally slightly lower, and the fourth measurement results are generally significantly higher. During the third test, there was suspected "air leakage" noise during the ventilation rate measurement, and during the fourth test, the standard rod had been inspected for a week.
