# Figure 4-7 Influence of temperature on the change rates of three standard rods with ventilation rate

（a）For the 17.6% ventilation rate standard rod, the linear relationship between ventilation rate change value and temperature is y=0.0518x-1.1753, R2=0.9891; for the 45.3% ventilation rate standard rod, the linear relationship between ventilation rate change value and temperature is y=0.1431x-3.2725, R2=0.9470; for the 81.6% ventilation rate standard rod, the linear relationship between ventilation rate change value and temperature is y=0.2203x-5.0244, R2=0.9564.

（b）The linearity of the measured values of the ventilation rate standard rod with temperature is poor.

（c）With every 1°C increase in temperature, the measured values of the 17.6%, 45.3%, 81.6% ventilation rate standard rods increase by 0.05%, 0.14%, 0.22% respectively.

（a）The measured values of the low, middle, and high ventilation rate standard rods all increase with the rise in temperature, showing a positive correlation.

（b）At temperatures of 22.43°C and 22.49°C, the relative error of the ventilation rate measurement does not exceed ±0.25%, indicating good repeatability.
