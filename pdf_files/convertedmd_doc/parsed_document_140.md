Abstract：In order to investigate the effects of online laser perforation parameters on cigarette ventilation rate and the deliveries of tar，nicotine and carbon monoxide in mainstream cigarette smoke，the cigarette samples with different hole numbers and perforated with different laser pulse durations were prepared，the relationships of the said parameters with cigarette ventilation rate，the consistence of ventilation rate and the deliveries of routine smoke constituents were analyzed. Meanwhile，a single factor experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of row number and position of perforation on the physical and chemical indexes of cigarette. The results showed that: 1) Within the test range，laser pulse duration affected cigarette ventilation rate and routine smoke constituent deliveries more significantly than did hole number；laser pulse duration and hole number did not affect the ratio of signal to noise of cigarette ventilation rate obviously，but affected the mean value of ventilation rate significantly，which increased with the increase of hole number and laser pulse duration；the correlation between hole number and the
