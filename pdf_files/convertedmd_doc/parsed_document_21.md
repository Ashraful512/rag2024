Abstract: In order to obtain blended cigarette products with different tar deliveries, the relationship among the ventilation rates of cigarette, tipping paper, and cigarette paper was investigated with single-line or two-line online laser perforation, and a mathematical model between the ventilation rate of tipping paper and tar delivery was established. The results showed that: 1) for cigarettes of low ventilation rate, the ventilation rate of cigarette paper played a major role, while for cigarettes of high ventilation rate, the ventilation rate of tipping paper played a major role; 2) for blended cigarette products of low tar delivery, especially those with about 45% ventilation rate, two-line online laser perforation should be adopted, while for products with relatively higher tar delivery and low ventilation tipping paper, single-line online laser perforation was generally adopted; 3) the parameters of online laser perforation could be adjusted according to the ventilation rate of tipping paper calculated with the mathematical model to meet the requirements of product design.

At present, domestic cigarette companies use online laser perforation systems to reduce cigarette tar. However, when developing a new cigarette brand using an online laser perforation system, repeated testing and corrections are needed to produce products that meet the requirements of blended cigarette design. This process involves a large amount of work, is time-consuming, results in significant fluctuations in cigarette tar, and is not conducive to using computer-simulated cigarette design.
