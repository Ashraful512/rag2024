(a) As the temperature rises, the measured values of the three standard rods for ventilation rate decrease slightly, indicating no direct relationship between temperature and ventilation rate measurement values.

(b) The measured values of the three standard rods for ventilation rate show small fluctuations as the temperature increases.

(a) For the 3 standard rods for ventilation rate, the measured values decrease slightly after the temperature rises.(b) Using 17.6% and 81.6% standard rods for calibration, the measured values of the low rod show the smallest fluctuations at different temperatures, while the measured values of the medium and high rods show relatively larger fluctuations.(c) Calibration using ventilation rate standard rods can effectively reduce the impact of temperature on the measurement of ventilation rate standard rods.
