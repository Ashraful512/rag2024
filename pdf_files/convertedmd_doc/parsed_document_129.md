# Figure 4-41 Ventilation rate unit five times measurement control diagram

(a) The comprehensive test bench measured 3 ventilation rate standard rods at 17.64%, 45.31%, and 81.66% respectively, 4 times each, and the measurement results were within the control limits.

(b) The actual values of the four measurements compared to the standard values varied, but the fluctuations were small.

5. Summary of conventional control chart method

(a) The comprehensive test bench is not used for a long time and is not in an effective calibration state. The ventilation rate measurement results may be qualified or unqualified.

(b) Except for the abnormal results of instrument C and instrument D1, the ventilation rate measurements are within the control limits.

(c) Instruments with high frequency of use are prone to aging of parts such as latex tubes and sealing rings of the measuring head, causing air leakage and resulting in serious abnormal measurement data.

# 4.3.2.4 Summary

(1) The verification standard method is suitable for the ventilation rate unit, simple and easy to operate, economically practical.

(2) The multiple sets of comparison method are suitable for the ventilation rate unit, but it requires multiple instruments to measure the same ventilation rate standard rod, which is relatively cumbersome to operate.

(3) The conventional control chart is suitable for the ventilation rate unit, but it requires multiple measurements of the same ventilation rate standard rod, which is time-consuming.

The best periodic verification method for the ventilation rate unit is the verification standard method.
