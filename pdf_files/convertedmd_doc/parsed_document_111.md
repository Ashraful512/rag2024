# Figure 4-17 Error of four ventilation rate measurements

（a）The comprehensive test bench measured three ventilation rate standard rods of 17.64%, 45.31%, and 81.66% four times each, with little fluctuation in the results.

（b）In the four test results, the maximum error at 17.64% is -0.9%, and the minimum error is -0.5%; at 45.31%, the maximum error is -1.4%, and the minimum error is -1.2%; at 81.66%, the maximum error is -1.0%, and the minimum error is -0.4%.

（c）The comprehensive test bench is within the maximum allowable error range at 17.64%, 45.31%, and 81.66% ventilation rates.
