# 4.1.2 Impact of Plug Paper Air Permeability, Forming Paper Air Permeability, and Punch Hole Count on Total Ventilation of Cigarettes

(1) Impact of Forming Paper Air Permeability on Total Ventilation of Cigarettes

Figure 4-4 shows that the total ventilation of cigarettes first increases and then decreases with the increase of forming paper air permeability. A1-A3 have a larger increase, A3 slows down after, and A5 starts to decrease slightly later, indicating that the total ventilation of cigarettes can be adjusted by the air permeability of forming paper. However, after the air permeability increases to 5500CU, the total ventilation of cigarettes increases slowly, and after the air permeability increases to 7500CU, the impact of air permeability on ventilation rate decreases slightly.
