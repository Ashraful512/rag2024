(3) The effect of pinhole pitch on the total ventilation rate of cigarettes

Figure 4-6 shows that the total ventilation rate of cigarettes increases with the increasing pinhole pitch. There is a linear relationship between the pinhole pitch and the total ventilation rate of cigarettes, with the relationship equation being y=4.59x+21.917, R2=0.9984 (Note: x is an integer).
