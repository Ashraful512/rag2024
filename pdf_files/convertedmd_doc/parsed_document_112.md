# Figure 4-18 Error of five ventilation rate measurements

(a) The comprehensive test bench measured 3 standard ventilation rods at 17.64%, 45.31%, and 81.66% five times each, with small fluctuations in the results.

(b) In the 5 test results, the maximum error at 17.64% is -0.52%, and the minimum error is 0.14%; at 45.31%, the maximum error is -0.51%, and the minimum error is -0.09%; at 81.66%, the maximum error is 0.83%, and the minimum error is 0.24%.

(c) The comprehensive test bench's ventilation rates at 17.64%, 45.31%, and 81.66% are all within the maximum allowable error range.
