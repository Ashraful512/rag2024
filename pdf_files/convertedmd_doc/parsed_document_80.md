(2) Influence of air permeability of interlayer paper on total ventilation rate of cigarette

Figure 4-5 shows that with the increase of air permeability of interlayer paper, the total ventilation rate increases accordingly. There is a linear relationship between the air permeability of interlayer paper and the total ventilation rate of cigarettes, with a linear equation of y=0.024x+24.93; RÂ²= 0.971.
